See the collecting function described in detail in the next section.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong><code>options</code></strong>: Optional. A plain object. If some of the props to your component are not scalar (that is, are not primitive values or functions), specifying a custom <code>arePropsEqual(props, otherProps)</code> function inside the <code>options</code> object can improve the performance. Unless you have performance problems, don&#39;t worry about it.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>The Collecting Function<a id=\\\"the-collecting-function\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><p>The collecting function signature is similar to the collecting functions of <a href=\\\"docs-drag-source.html\\\"><code>DragSource</code></a> and <a href=\\\"docs-drop-target.html\\\"><code>DropTarget</code></a>, except that it doesn&#39;t have a <code>connect</code> parameter because the drag layer is not interactive and only <em>reflects</em> the drag state. The collecting function is called any time the global drag state changes, including the coordinate changes, so that your component can provide a timely updated custom drag preview. You can ask the <code>monitor</code> for the client coordinates of the dragged item.</p>\\n<h4>Parameters<a id=\\\"parameters\\\">&nbsp;</a></h4><ul>\\n<li><strong><code>monitor</code></strong>: An instance of <a href=\\\"docs-drag-layer-monitor.html\\\"><code>DragLayerMonitor</code></a>. You can use it to query the information about the current drag state, including the coordinates. Read the <a href=\\\"docs-drag-layer-monitor.html\\\"><code>DragLayerMonitor</code> documentation</a> for a complete list of <code>monitor</code> methods, or read the <a href=\\\"docs-overview.html\\\">overview</a> for an introduction to the monitors.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Return Value<a id=\\\"return-value\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><p><code>DragLayer</code> wraps your component and returns another React component.<br/>For easier <a href=\\\"docs-testing.html\\\">testing</a>, it provides an API to reach into the internals:</p>\\n<h4>Static Properties<a id=\\\"static-properties\\\">&nbsp;</a></h4><ul>\\n<li><strong><code>DecoratedComponent</code></strong>: Returns the wrapped component type.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>Instance Methods<a id=\\\"instance-methods\\\">&nbsp;</a></h4><ul>\\n<li><strong><code>getDecoratedComponentInstance()</code></strong>: Returns the wrapped component instance.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Example<a

You may optionally pass <code>{ shallow: true }</code> to strictly check whether <em>only</em> the owner is being hovered, as opposed to a nested target.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong><code>getItemType()</code></strong>: Returns a string or an ES6 symbol identifying the type of the current dragged item. Returns <code>null</code> if no item is being dragged.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong><code>getItem()</code></strong>: Returns a plain object representing the currently dragged item. Every drag source must specify it by returning an object from its <code>beginDrag()</code> method. Returns <code>null</code> if no item is being dragged.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong><code>getDropResult()</code></strong>: Returns a plain object representing the last recorded drop result. The drop targets may optionally specify it by returning an object from their <code>drop()</code> methods. When a chain of <code>drop()</code> is dispatched for the nested targets, bottom up, any parent that explicitly returns its own result from <code>drop()</code> overrides the drop result previously set by the child. Returns <code>null</code> if called outside <code>drop()</code>.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong><code>didDrop()</code></strong> Returns <code>true</code> if some drop target has handled the drop event, <code>false</code> otherwise. Even if a target did not return a drop result, <code>didDrop()</code> returns <code>true</code>. Use it inside <code>drop()</code> to test whether any nested drop target has already handled the drop.

Returns <code>null</code> if no item is being dragged.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong><code>getDifferenceFromInitialOffset()</code></strong>: Returns the <code>{ x, y }</code> difference between the last recorded client offset of the pointer and the client offset when current the drag operation has started. Returns <code>null</code> if no item is being dragged.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong><code>getSourceClientOffset()</code></strong>: Returns the projected <code>{ x, y }</code> client offset of the drag source component&#39;s root DOM node, based on its position at the time when the current drag operation has started, and the movement difference.

This will pass the returned function to your component as a prop. You can then use it inside <code>render</code> or <code>componentDidMount</code> to indicate a DOM node should react to drop target events. Internally it works by attaching a <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/more-about-refs.html#the-ref-callback-attribute\\\">callback ref</a> to the React element you give it. This callback connects the DOM node of your component to the chosen DnD backend.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong><code>dropTarget() =&gt; (elementOrNode)</code></strong>: Returns a function that must be used inside the component to assign the drop target role to a node. By returning <code>{ connectDropTarget: connect.dropTarget() }</code> from your collecting function, you can mark any React element as the droppable node. To do that, replace any <code>element</code> with <code>this.props.connectDropTarget(element)</code> inside the <code>render</code> function.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Example<a

A string, an ES6 symbol, an array of either, or a function that returns either of those, given component&#39;s <code>props</code>. This drop target will only react to the items produced by the <a href=\\\"docs-drag-source.html\\\">drag sources</a> of the specified type or types. Read the <a href=\\\"docs-overview.html\\\">overview</a> to learn more about the items and types.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong><code>spec</code></strong>: Required. A plain JavaScript object with a few allowed methods on it. It describes how the drop target reacts to the drag and drop events. See the drop target specification described in detail in the next section.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong><code>collect</code></strong>: Required. The collecting function. It should return a plain object of the props to inject into your component. It receives two parameters: <code>connect</code> and <code>monitor</code>. Read the <a href=\\\"docs-overview.html\\\">overview</a> for an introduction to the monitors, the connectors, and the collecting function. See the collecting function described in detail after the next section.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong><code>options</code></strong>: Optional. A plain object. If some of the props to your component are not scalar (that is, are not primitive values or functions), specifying a custom <code>arePropsEqual(props, otherProps)</code> function inside the <code>options</code> object can improve the performance. Unless you have performance problems, don&#39;t worry about it.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Drop Target Specification<a id=\\\"drop-target-specification\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><p>The second <code>spec</code> parameter must be a plain object implementing the drop target specification. Below is the list of all methods that it may have.</p>\\n<h4>Specification Methods<a id=\\\"specification-methods\\\">&nbsp;</a></h4><ul>\\n<li><p><strong><code>drop(props, monitor, component)</code></strong>: Optional. Called when a compatible item is dropped on the target. You may either return undefined, or a plain object. If you return an object, it is going to become <em>the drop result</em> and will be available to the drag source in its <code>endDrag</code> method as <code>monitor.getDropResult()</code>. This is useful in case you want to perform different actions depending on which target received the drop. If you have nested drop targets, you can test whether a nested target has already handled <code>drop</code> by checking <code>monitor.didDrop()</code> and <code>monitor.getDropResult()</code>. Both this method and the source&#39;s <code>endDrag</code> method are good places to fire Flux actions. This method will not be called if <code>canDrop()</code> is defined and returns <code>false</code>.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong><code>hover(props, monitor, component)</code></strong>: Optional. Called when an item is hovered over the component. You can check <code>monitor.isOver({ shallow: true })</code> to test whether the hover happens over <em>just</em> the current target, or over a nested one. Unlike <code>drop()</code>, this method will be called even if <code>canDrop()</code> is defined and returns <code>false</code>. You can check <code>monitor.canDrop()</code> to test whether this is the case.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong><code>canDrop(props, monitor)</code></strong>: Optional. Use it to specify whether the drop target is able to accept the item. If you want to always allow it, just omit this method. Specifying it is handy if you&#39;d like to disable dropping based on some predicate over <code>props</code> or <code>monitor.getItem()</code>. <em>Note: You may not call <code>monitor.canDrop()</code> inside this method.</em></p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>The spec offers no methods to handle enter or leave events by purpose.</strong> Instead, return the result of <code>monitor.isOver()</code> call from your <em>collecting function</em>, so that you can use the <code>componentDidUpdate</code> React hook to process the entering and the leaving events in your component. You may also check <code>monitor.isOver({ shallow: true })</code> if don&#39;t want the nested drop targets to count.</p>\\n<h4>Specification Method Parameters<a id=\\\"specification-method-parameters\\\">&nbsp;</a></h4><ul>\\n<li><p><strong><code>props</code></strong>: Your component&#39;s current props.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong><code>monitor</code></strong>: An instance of <a href=\\\"docs-drop-target-monitor.html\\\"><code>DropTargetMonitor</code></a>. Use it to query the information about the current drag state, such as the currently dragged item and its type, the current and initial coordinates and offsets, whether it is over the current target, and whether it can be dropped. Read the <a href=\\\"docs-drop-target-monitor.html\\\"><code>DropTargetMonitor</code> documentation</a> for a complete list of <code>monitor</code> methods, or read the <a href=\\\"docs-overview.html\\\">overview</a> for an introduction to the monitors.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong><code>component</code></strong>: When specified, it is the instance of your component. Use it to access the underlying DOM node for position or size measurements, or to call <code>setState</code>, and other component methods. It is purposefully missing from <code>canDrop</code> because the instance may not be available by the time it is called. If you want this method to depend on the component&#39;s state, consider lifting the state to the parent component, so that you can just use <code>props</code>. Generally your code will be cleaner if you rely on <code>props</code> instead whenever possible. Do note this is always <code>null</code> when hovering <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html#stateless-functions\\\">stateless components</a>.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>The Collecting Function<a id=\\\"the-collecting-function\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><p>Just specifying the drop target <code>types</code> and <code>spec</code> is not quite enough.<br/>There&#39;s still a few more things we need to take care of:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>connect the React DnD event handlers to some node in the component;</li>\\n<li>pass some knowledge about the dragging state to our component.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>All communication between the React components happens via props, so it makes sense that React DnD injects special props into your component. However it gives you the freedom to name them and decide what props your component will receive.</p>\\n<p>Your <em>collecting function</em> will be called by React DnD with a <em>connector</em> that lets you connect nodes to the DnD backend, and a <em>monitor</em> to query information about the drag state. It should return a plain object of props to inject into your component.</p>\\n<p>If you&#39;re new to these concepts, the <a href=\\\"docs-overview.html\\\">overview</a> should give you a good idea about them.</p>\\n<h4>Parameters<a id=\\\"parameters\\\">&nbsp;</a></h4><ul>\\n<li><p><strong><code>connect</code></strong>: An instance of <a href=\\\"docs-drop-target-connector.html\\\"><code>DropTargetConnector</code></a>. It only has a single <code>dropTarget()</code> method. It returns a function you need to pass down to your component to connect the target DOM node to the React DnD backend. If you return something like <code>{ connectDropTarget: connect.dropTarget() }</code> from your <code>collect</code> function, the component will receive <code>connectDropTarget</code> as a prop so you can mark the relevant node inside its <code>render()</code> as droppable: <code>return this.props.connectDropTarget(&lt;div&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;)</code>. You can see this pattern in action in the example at the end of this file. Read the <a href=\\\"docs-drop-target-connector.html\\\"><code>DropTargetConnector</code> documentation</a> for a complete list of <code>connect</code> methods, or read the <a href=\\\"docs-overview.html\\\">overview</a> for an introduction to the connectors.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong><code>monitor</code></strong>: An instance of <a href=\\\"docs-drop-target-monitor.html\\\"><code>DropTargetMonitor</code></a>. It is precisely the same <code>monitor</code> you receive in the drop target specification methods, and you can use it to query the information about the current drag state. Read the <a href=\\\"docs-drop-target-monitor.html\\\"><code>DropTargetMonitor</code> documentation</a> for a complete list of <code>monitor</code> methods, or read the <a href=\\\"docs-overview.html\\\">overview</a> for an introduction to the monitors.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Return Value<a id=\\\"return-value\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><p><code>DropTarget</code> wraps your component and returns another React component.<br/>For easier <a href=\\\"docs-testing.html\\\">testing</a>, it provides an API to reach into the internals:</p>\\n<h4>Static Properties<a id=\\\"static-properties\\\">&nbsp;</a></h4><ul>\\n<li><strong><code>DecoratedComponent</code></strong>: Returns the wrapped component type.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>Instance Methods<a id=\\\"instance-methods\\\">&nbsp;</a></h4><ul>\\n<li><p><strong><code>getDecoratedComponentInstance()</code></strong>: Returns the wrapped component instance.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong><code>getHandlerId()</code></strong>: Returns the drag source ID that can be used to simulate the drag and drop events with the testing backend. Refer to the <a href=\\\"docs-testing.html\\\">testing</a> tutorial for a usage example.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Nesting Behavior<a id=\\\"nesting-behavior\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><p>If a drop target is nested in another drop target, both <code>hover()</code> and <code>drop()</code> bubble from the innermost target up the chain. There is no way to cancel the propagation by design. Instead, any drop target may compare <code>monitor.isOver()</code> and <code>monitor.isOver({ shallow: true })</code> to verify whether a child, or just the current drop target is being hovered. When dropping, any drop target in the chain may check whether it is the first in chain by testing if <code>monitor.didDrop()</code> returns <code>false</code>. Any parent drop target may override the drop result specified by the child drop target by explicitly returning another drop result from <code>drop()</code>. If a parent target returns <code>undefined</code> from its <code>drop()</code> handler, it does not change the existing drop result that may have been specified by a nested drop target. The drop targets that return <code>false</code> from <code>canDrop()</code> are excluded from the <code>drop()</code> dispatch.</p>\\n<h3>Handling Files and URLs<a id=\\\"handling-files-and-urls\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><p>When using the <a href=\\\"docs-html5-backend.html\\\">HTML5 backend</a>, you can handle the file drops just by registering a drop target for <code>HTML5Backend.NativeTypes.FILE</code> or <code>HTML5Backend.NativeTypes.URL</code> built-in types. Due to the browser security restrictions, <code>monitor.getItem()</code> does not provide any information about the files or the URLs until they are dropped.</p>\\n<h3>Example<a

id=\\\"dragsourceconnector\\\">&nbsp;</a></h1><p><code>DragSourceConnector</code> is an object passed to a collecting function of the <a href=\\\"docs-drag-source.html\\\"><code>DragSource</code></a>. Its methods return functions that let you assign the roles to your component&#39;s DOM nodes.</p>\\n<h3>Methods<a id=\\\"methods\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><p>Call the <code>DragSourceConnector</code> methods inside your <em>collecting function</em>. This will pass the returned functions to your component as props. You can then use them inside <code>render</code> or <code>componentDidMount</code> to indicate the DOM node roles. Internally they work by attaching a <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/more-about-refs.html#the-ref-callback-attribute\\\">callback ref</a> to the React elements you give them. These callbacks connect the DOM nodes of your component to the chosen DnD backend.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><p><strong><code>dragSource() =&gt; (elementOrNode, options?)</code></strong>: Returns a function that must be used inside the component to assign the drag source role to a node. By returning <code>{ connectDragSource: connect.dragSource() }</code> from your collecting function, you can mark any React element as the draggable node. To do that, replace any <code>element</code> with <code>this.props.connectDragSource(element)</code> inside the <code>render</code> function.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong><code>dragPreview() =&gt; (elementOrNode, options?)</code></strong>: Optional. Returns a function that may be used inside the component to assign the drag preview role to a node. By returning <code>{ connectDragPreview: connect.dragPreview() }</code> from your collecting function, you can mark any React element as the drag preview node. To do that, replace any <code>element</code> with <code>this.props.connectDragPreview(element)</code> inside the <code>render</code> function. The drag preview is the node that will be screenshotted by the <a href=\\\"docs-html5-backend.html\\\">HTML5 backend</a> when the drag begins. For example, if you want to make something draggable by a small custom handle, you can mark this handle as the <code>dragSource()</code>, but also mark an outer, larger component node as the <code>dragPreview()</code>. Thus the larger drag preview appears on the screenshot, but only the smaller drag source is actually draggable. Another possible customization is passing an <a href=\\\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/Image\\\"><code>Image</code></a> instance to <code>dragPreview</code> from a lifecycle method like <code>componentDidMount</code>. This lets you use the actual images for drag previews. (Note that IE does not support this customization). See the example code below for the different usage examples.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Method Options<a id=\\\"method-options\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><p>The functions returned by the connector methods also accept options. They need to be passed <em>inside the component</em>, for example, <code>this.props.connectDragSource(&lt;div&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;, { dropEffect: &#39;copy&#39; })</code>. The options described below are supported by the <a href=\\\"./docs-html5-backend.html\\\">HTML5 backend</a>, but may not be supported by the third-party or custom backends.</p>\\n<h4><strong>Options for <code>dragSource</code></strong><a id=\\\"-strong-options-for-code-dragsource-code-strong-\\\">&nbsp;</a></h4><ul>\\n<li><code>dropEffect</code>: Optional. A string. By default, <code>&#39;move&#39;</code>. In the browsers that support this feature, specifying <code>&#39;copy&#39;</code> shows a special “copying” cursor, while <code>&#39;move&#39;</code> corresponds to the “move” cursor. You might want to use this option to provide a hint to the user about whether an action is destructive.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4><strong>Options for <code>dragPreview</code></strong><a id=\\\"-strong-options-for-code-dragpreview-code-strong-\\\">&nbsp;</a></h4><ul>\\n<li><p><code>captureDraggingState</code>: Optional. A boolean. By default, <code>false</code>. If <code>true</code>, the component will learn that it is being dragged immediately as the drag starts instead of the next tick. This means that the screenshotting would occur with <code>monitor.isDragging()</code> already being <code>true</code>, and if you apply any styling like a decreased opacity to the dragged element, this styling will also be reflected on the screenshot. This is rarely desirable, so <code>false</code> is a sensible default. However, you might want to set it to <code>true</code> in rare cases, such as if you want to make the custom drag layers work in IE and you need to hide the original element without resorting to an empty drag preview which IE doesn&#39;t support.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><code>anchorX</code>: Optional. A number between <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>. By default, <code>0.5</code>. Specifies how the offset relative to the drag source node is translated into the horizontal offset of the drag preview when their sizes don&#39;t match. <code>0</code> means “dock the preview to the left”, <code>0.5</code> means “interpolate linearly” and <code>1</code> means “dock the preview to the right”.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><code>anchorY</code>: Optional. A number between <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>. By default, <code>0.5</code>. Specifies how the offset relative to the drag source node is translated into the vertical offset of the drag preview when their sizes don&#39;t match. <code>0</code> means “dock the preview to the top, <code>0.5</code> means “interpolate linearly” and <code>1</code> means “dock the preview to the bottom.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><code>offsetX</code>: Optional. A number or null if not needed. By default, null. Specifies the vertical offset between the cursor and the drag preview element. If offsetX has a value, anchorX won&#39;t be used.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><code>offsetY</code>: Optional. A number or null if not needed. By default, null. Specifies the vertical offset between the cursor and the drag preview element. If offsetY has a value, anchorY won&#39;t be used.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Example<a id=\\\"example\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><p>Check out <a href=\\\"docs-tutorial.html\\\">the tutorial</a> for more real

href=\\\"docs-overview.html\\\">Read the overview</a> before jumping into the docs.</em></p>\\n<h1>DragSourceMonitor<a id=\\\"dragsourcemonitor\\\">&nbsp;</a></h1><p><code>DragSourceMonitor</code> is an object passed to a collecting function of the <a href=\\\"docs-drag-source.html\\\"><code>DragSource</code></a>. Its methods let you get information about the drag state of a specific drag source. The specific drag source bound to that monitor is called the monitor&#39;s <em>owner</em> below.</p>\\n<h3>Methods<a id=\\\"methods\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><ul>\\n<li><p><strong><code>canDrag()</code></strong>: Returns <code>true</code> if no drag operation is in progress, and the owner&#39;s <code>canDrag()</code> returns <code>true</code> or is not defined.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong><code>isDragging()</code></strong>: Returns <code>true</code> if a drag operation is in progress, and either the owner initiated the drag, or its <code>isDragging()</code> is defined and returns <code>true</code>.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong><code>getItemType()</code></strong>: Returns a string or an ES6 symbol identifying the type of the current dragged item. Returns <code>null</code> if no item is being dragged.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong><code>getItem()</code></strong>: Returns a plain object representing the currently dragged item. Every drag source must specify it by returning an object from its <code>beginDrag()</code> method. Returns <code>null</code> if no item is being dragged.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong><code>getDropResult()</code></strong>: Returns a plain object representing the last recorded drop result. The drop targets may optionally specify it by returning an object from their <code>drop()</code> methods. When a chain of <code>drop()</code> is dispatched for the nested targets, bottom up, any parent that explicitly returns its own result from <code>drop()</code> overrides the child drop result previously set by the child. Returns <code>null</code> if called outside <code>endDrag()</code>.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong><code>didDrop()</code></strong> Returns <code>true</code> if some drop target has handled the drop event, <code>false</code> otherwise. Even if a target did not return a drop result, <code>didDrop()</code> returns <code>true</code>. Use it inside <code>endDrag()</code> to test whether any drop target has handled the drop. Returns <code>false</code> if called outside <code>endDrag()</code>.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong><code>getInitialClientOffset()</code></strong>: Returns the <code>{ x, y }</code> client offset of the pointer at the time when the current drag operation has started. Returns <code>null</code> if no item is being dragged.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong><code>getInitialSourceClientOffset()</code></strong>: Returns the <code>{ x, y }</code> client offset of the drag source component&#39;s root DOM node at the time when the current drag operation has started. Returns <code>null</code> if no item is being dragged.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong><code>getClientOffset()</code></strong>: Returns the last recorded <code>{ x, y }</code> client offset of the pointer while a drag operation is in progress.

They are described in detail below.</p>\\n<p>To use <code>DragSource</code>, don&#39;t forget to wrap the top-level component of your app in a <a href=\\\"docs-drag-drop-context.html\\\"><code>DragDropContext</code></a>.</p>\\n<h3>Signature<a id=\\\"signature\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><p><code>DragSource</code> uses partial application. After specifying its parameters with the first call, you need to pass your React component class as the only parameter in the second call. This signature makes <code>DragSource</code> usable as an ES7 decorator.

Either a string, an ES6 symbol, or a function that returns either given the component&#39;s <code>props</code>. Only the <a href=\\\"docs-drop-target.html\\\">drop targets</a> registered for the same type will react to the items produced by this drag source. Read the <a href=\\\"docs-overview.html\\\">overview</a> to learn more about the items and types.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong><code>spec</code></strong>: Required. A plain JavaScript object with a few allowed methods on it. It describes how the drag source reacts to the drag and drop events. See the drag source specification described in detail in the next section.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong><code>collect</code></strong>: Required. The collecting function. It should return a plain object of the props to inject into your component. It receives two parameters: <code>connect</code> and <code>monitor</code>. Read the <a href=\\\"docs-overview.html\\\">overview</a> for an introduction to the monitors, the connectors, and the collecting function. See the collecting function described in detail after the next section.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong><code>options</code></strong>: Optional. A plain object. If some of the props to your component are not scalar (that is, are not primitive values or functions), specifying a custom <code>arePropsEqual(props, otherProps)</code> function inside the <code>options</code> object can improve the performance. Unless you have performance problems, don&#39;t worry about it.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Drag Source Specification<a id=\\\"drag-source-specification\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><p>The second <code>spec</code> parameter must be a plain object implementing the drag source specification. Below is the list of all methods that it may have.</p>\\n<h4>Specification Methods<a id=\\\"specification-methods\\\">&nbsp;</a></h4><ul>\\n<li><p><strong><code>beginDrag(props, monitor, component)</code></strong>: Required. When the dragging starts, <code>beginDrag</code> is called. You must return a plain JavaScript object describing the data being dragged. What you return is the <em>only</em> information available to the drop targets about the drag source so it&#39;s important to pick the <em>minimal</em> data they need to know. You may be tempted to put a reference to the <code>component</code> into it, but you should try very hard to avoid doing this because it couples the drag sources and drop targets. It&#39;s a good idea to return something like <code>{ id: props.id }</code> from this method.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong><code>endDrag(props, monitor, component)</code></strong>: Optional. When the dragging stops, <code>endDrag</code> is called. For every <code>beginDrag</code> call, a corresponding <code>endDrag</code> call is guaranteed. You may call <code>monitor.didDrop()</code> to check whether or not the drop was handled by a compatible drop target. If it was handled, and the drop target specified a <em>drop result</em> by returning a plain object from its <code>drop()</code> method, it will be available as <code>monitor.getDropResult()</code>. This method is a good place to fire a Flux action. <em>Note: If the component is unmounted while dragging, <code>component</code> parameter is set to be <code>null</code>.</em></p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong><code>canDrag(props, monitor)</code></strong>: Optional. Use it to specify whether the dragging is currently allowed. If you want to always allow it, just omit this method. Specifying it is handy if you&#39;d like to disable dragging based on some predicate over <code>props</code>. <em>Note: You may not call <code>monitor.canDrag()</code> inside this method.</em></p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong><code>isDragging(props, monitor)</code></strong>: Optional. By default, only the drag source that initiated the drag operation is considered to be dragging. You can override this behavior by defining a custom <code>isDragging</code> method. It might return something like <code>props.id === monitor.getItem().id</code>. Do this if the original component may be unmounted during the dragging and later “resurrected” with a different parent. For example, when moving a card across the lists in a Kanban board, you want it to retain the dragged appearance—even though technically, the component gets unmounted and a different one gets mounted every time you move it to another list. <em>Note: You may not call <code>monitor.isDragging()</code> inside this method.</em></p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>Specification Method Parameters<a id=\\\"specification-method-parameters\\\">&nbsp;</a></h4><ul>\\n<li><p><strong><code>props</code></strong>: Your component&#39;s current props.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong><code>monitor</code></strong>: An instance of <a href=\\\"docs-drag-source-monitor.html\\\"><code>DragSourceMonitor</code></a>. Use it to query the information about the current drag state, such as the currently dragged item and its type, the current and initial coordinates and offsets, and whether it was dropped yet. Read the <a href=\\\"docs-drag-source-monitor.html\\\"><code>DragSourceMonitor</code> documentation</a> for a complete list of <code>monitor</code> methods, or read the <a href=\\\"docs-overview.html\\\">overview</a> for an introduction to the monitors.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong><code>component</code></strong>: When specified, it is the instance of your component. Use it to access the underlying DOM node for position or size measurements, or to call <code>setState</code>, and other component methods. It is purposefully missing from <code>isDragging</code> and <code>canDrag</code> because the instance may not be available by the time they are called. If you want these methods to depend on the component&#39;s state, consider lifting the state to the parent component, so that you can just use <code>props</code>. Generally your code will be cleaner if you rely on <code>props</code> instead whenever possible.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>The Collecting Function<a id=\\\"the-collecting-function\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><p>Just specifying the drag source <code>type</code> and <code>spec</code> is not quite enough.<br/>There&#39;s still a few more things we need to take care of:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>connect the React DnD event handlers to some node in the component;</li>\\n<li>pass some knowledge about the dragging state to our component.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>All communication between the React components happens via props, so it makes sense that React DnD injects special props into your component. However it gives you the freedom to name them and decide what props your component will receive.</p>\\n<p>Your <em>collecting function</em> will be called by React DnD with a <em>connector</em> that lets you connect nodes to the DnD backend, and a <em>monitor</em> to query information about the drag state. It should return a plain object of props to inject into your component.</p>\\n<p>If you&#39;re new to these concepts, the <a href=\\\"docs-overview.html\\\">overview</a> should give you a good idea about them.</p>\\n<h4>Parameters<a id=\\\"parameters\\\">&nbsp;</a></h4><ul>\\n<li><p><strong><code>connect</code></strong>: An instance of <a href=\\\"docs-drag-source-connector.html\\\"><code>DragSourceConnector</code></a>. It has two methods: <code>dragPreview()</code> and <code>dragSource()</code>. Of them, <code>dragSource()</code> is the one you&#39;ll use the most. It returns a function you need to pass down to your component to connect the source DOM node to the React DnD backend. If you return something like <code>{ connectDragSource: connect.dragSource() }</code> from your <code>collect</code> function, the component will receive <code>connectDragSource</code> as a prop so you can mark the relevant node inside its <code>render()</code> as draggable: <code>return this.props.connectDragSource(&lt;div&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;)</code>. You can see this pattern in action in the example at the end of this file. Read the <a href=\\\"docs-drag-source-connector.html\\\"><code>DragSourceConnector</code> documentation</a> for a complete list of <code>connect</code> methods, or read the <a href=\\\"docs-overview.html\\\">overview</a> for an introduction to the connectors.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong><code>monitor</code></strong>: An instance of <a href=\\\"docs-drag-source-monitor.html\\\"><code>DragSourceMonitor</code></a>. It is precisely the same <code>monitor</code> you receive in the drag source specification methods, and you can use it to query the information about the current drag state. Read the <a href=\\\"docs-drag-source-monitor.html\\\"><code>DragSourceMonitor</code> documentation</a> for a complete list of <code>monitor</code> methods, or read the <a href=\\\"docs-overview.html\\\">overview</a> for an introduction to the monitors.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Return Value<a id=\\\"return-value\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><p><code>DragSource</code> wraps your component and returns another React component.<br/>For easier <a href=\\\"docs-testing.html\\\">testing</a>, it provides an API to reach into the internals:</p>\\n<h4>Static Properties<a id=\\\"static-properties\\\">&nbsp;</a></h4><ul>\\n<li><strong><code>DecoratedComponent</code></strong>: Returns the wrapped component type.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>Instance Methods<a id=\\\"instance-methods\\\">&nbsp;</a></h4><ul>\\n<li><p><strong><code>getDecoratedComponentInstance()</code></strong>: Returns the wrapped component instance.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong><code>getHandlerId()</code></strong>: Returns the drag source ID that can be used to simulate the drag and drop events with the testing backend. Refer to the <a href=\\\"docs-testing.html\\\">testing</a> tutorial for a usage example.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Nesting Behavior<a id=\\\"nesting-behavior\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><p>If a drag source is nested in another drag source, the innermost drag source of the compatible type wins. Drag sources that return <code>false</code> from <code>canDrag</code> are skipped. The chosen drag source is the only one that will receive <code>beginDrag</code> and, subsequently, <code>endDrag</code>. There is no propagation once the drag source is determined.</p>\\n<h3>Example<a id=\\\"example\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><p>Check out <a href=\\\"docs-tutorial.html\\\">the tutorial</a> for more real

It doesn&#39;t have to be the topmost component, but it has to be higher in the hierarchy than any of your component using React DnD. Wrap this component with a <a href=\\\"docs-drag-drop-context.html\\\"><code>DragDropContext</code></a> call. It is important to specify a <em>backend</em> as the only argument in that call. Currently React DnD only provides an <a href=\\\"docs-html5-backend.html\\\"><code>HTML5</code> backend</a>, but touch backend support is coming in the future.</p>\\n<h4>Stub the context inside the unit tests<a id=\\\"stub-the-context-inside-the-unit-tests\\\">&nbsp;</a></h4><p>If you have this error in a test, <a href=\\\"docs-testing.html\\\">read the testing guide</a> for instructions on

However they also include pre-minified UMD builds in the <code>dist</code> folders. The UMD builds export global <code>window.ReactDnD</code> and <code>window.ReactDnDHTML5Backend</code> respectively.</p>\\n<p>If you’d rather not use npm, you can use <a href=\\\"http://unpkg.com/\\\">unpkg</a> to access the UMD builds directly: <a href=\\\"https://unpkg.com/react-dnd@latest/dist/ReactDnD.min.js\\\">ReactDnD.min.js</a> and <a href=\\\"https://unpkg.com/react-dnd-html5-backend@latest/dist/ReactDnDHTML5Backend.min.js\\\">ReactDnDHTML5Backend.min.js</a>. You may point your Bower config to them.</p>\\n<h3>How do I test React DnD components and their interaction?<a id=\\\"how-do-i-test-react-dnd-components-and-their-interaction-\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><p>See the <a href=\\\"docs-testing.html\\\">testing</a> tutorial for examples.</p>\\n<h3>How do I make the component draggable only by a small handle?<a id=\\\"how-do-i-make-the-component-draggable-only-by-a-small-handle-\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><p>Specify the container node as the <code>dragPreview</code>, but only make the drag handle a <code>dragSource()</code>.\\nSee the <a href=\\\"examples-customize-handles-and-previews.html\\\">custom drag handle example</a>.</p>\\n<h3>How do I constrain the drag preview movement?<a id=\\\"how-do-i-constrain-the-drag-preview-movement-\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><p>By default, you can&#39;t constrain the drag preview movement because the drag preview is drawn by the browser. You can, however, use a <a href=\\\"examples-drag-around-custom-drag-layer.html\\\">custom drag layer</a> where you&#39;re free to rendering anything, with any snapping or constraints.</p>\\n<h3>How do I register a drag source or a drop target when the type depends on props?<a id=\\\"how-do-i-register-a-drag-source-or-a-drop-target-when-the-type-depends-on-props-\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><p>Both <a href=\\\"docs-drag-source.html\\\"><code>DragSource</code></a> and <a href=\\\"docs-drop-target.html\\\"><code>DropTarget</code></a> let you pass a function as the first parameter instead of a string or a symbol. If you pass a function, it will be given the current props, and it should return a string, a symbol, or (for drop targets only) an array of either.</p>\\n<h3>How do I combine several drag sources and drop targets in a single component?<a id=\\\"how-do-i-combine-several-drag-sources-and-drop-targets-in-a-single-component-\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><p>Because <a href=\\\"docs-drag-source.html\\\"><code>DragSource</code></a> and <a href=\\\"docs-drop-target.html\\\"><code>DropTarget</code></a> use the partial application, you may compose them using a functional composition helper such as <a href=\\\"https://lodash.com/docs#flow\\\"><code>_.flow</code></a>. In ES7, you can just stack the decorators to achieve the same effect.</p>\\n<h3>Why is the <code>component</code> parameter always <code>null</code> in the <code>beginDrag</code>/<code>endDrag</code>/<code>drop</code>/<code>hover</code> methods?<a id=\\\"why-is-the-code-component-code-parameter-always-code-null-code-in-the-code-begindrag-code-code-enddrag-code-code-drop-code-code-hover-code-methods-\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><p>When using <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html#stateless-functions\\\">stateless components</a>, the <code>component</code> parameter will always be <code>null</code> in the <code>beginDrag</code>/<code>endDrag</code>/<code>drop</code>/<code>hover</code> methods. This is because it is not possible to attach a ref to a stateless function component as explained in <a

href=\\\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGaBlygm0UY\\\">but I like it</a>.</p>\\n<h3>How stable is it?<a id=\\\"how-stable-is-it-\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><p><a href=\\\"http://stampsy.com\\\">Stampsy</a> has been using this library, as well as its non-React predecessor that it was based on, since 2013. It&#39;s central to the Stampsy user experience, because all the content is created in a drag and drop post editor that uses React DnD.</p>\\n<h3>What is the roadmap?<a id=\\\"what-is-the-roadmap-\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><p>The library is pretty much complete, and there are no new big features planned. Most of the new development now occurs outside React DnD—for example, there is an ongoing work on <a href=\\\"https://github.com/yahoo/react-dnd-touch-backend\\\">the touch backend</a> for it.</p>\\n<h3>Who made it and why?<a id=\\\"who-made-it-and-why-\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><p>React DnD was created by <a href=\\\"http://github.com/gaearon\\\">Dan Abramov</a>.</p>\\n<p>Its aim is to expose a powerful API that is browser-agnostic, data-centric, works great with React and Flux, and is testable and extensible. Read <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/the-future-of-drag-and-drop-apis-249dfea7a15f\\\">The Future of the Drag and Drop API</a> for some context.</p>\\n<p>It is loosely based on the pre-React code written at Stampsy by <a href=\\\"https://github.com/cavinsmith\\\">Andrew Kuznetsov</a>. Later it received valuable contributions from <a href=\\\"https://github.com/alexkuz\\\">Alexander Kuznetsov</a> and <a href=\\\"https://github.com/nelix\\\">Nathan Hutchison</a>.</p>\\n<p>React DnD would not have reached the 1.0 release without the generous donations from:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://macropod.com/\\\">Macropod</a>, a company developing team productivity software;</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://webflow.com/\\\">Webflow</a>, a company creating a professional responsive website builder.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://kkga.me/\\\">Gadzhi Kharkharov</a> styled the website, and the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/facebook/fixed-data-table\\\">fixed-data-table</a> project provided the website template.</p>\\n<h3>How Do I Contribute?<a id=\\\"how-do-i-contribute-\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><p>Contributing the documentation for the underlying <a href=\\\"https://github.com/react-dnd/dnd-core\\\">DnD Core</a> library would be a huge help, as it is currently not documented at all, but its concepts leak in some advanced scenarios such as <a href=\\\"docs-testing.html\\\">writing tests</a>.</p>\\n<p>Porting the library to other modern frameworks such as Cycle, Mercury, or Deku, is also appreciated. Such ports would be able to reuse DnD Core logic and the existing backends.</p>\\n<p>Please let me know via the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd/issues\\\">issue tracker</a> if you create advanced examples such as a Kanban board application, or write a blog post or record a screencast about React DnD, so I can link to it.</p>\\n<p>While DnD Core is fully tested, React DnD does not currently have any unit tests. Writing them is a great and eagerly desired contribution.</p>\\n<p>⚛</p>\\n\";","module.exports = \"<p><em>New to React DnD? <a href=\\\"docs-overview.html\\\">Read the overview</a> before jumping into the docs.</em></p>\\n<h1>Testing<a id=\\\"testing\\\">&nbsp;</a></h1><p>React DnD is test-friendly. The whole drag and drop interaction, including the rendering of your components, as well as the side effects you perform in response to the drag and drop events, can be tested.</p>\\n<p>There are several different approaches to testing React components. React DnD is not opinionated and lets you use either of them. <strong>Neither of those approaches require the browser event system to be available.</strong></p>\\n<p>A few test examples are included with the React DnD inside its <code>examples</code> folder. Run <code>yarn</code> and <code>yarn test</code> inside the <code>react-dnd</code> root folder to start them.</p>\\n<h3>Testing the Components in Isolation<a id=\\\"testing-the-components-in-isolation\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><p>If you are only interested in testing the <em>rendering</em> of your components in isolation, and not their interaction, you may use the <code>DecoratedComponent</code> static property available on any class wrapped with React DnD to access the original class.

the individual component rendering, you should use the <a href=\\\"docs-test-backend.html\\\">test backend</a>. <strong>The test backend does not require the DOM</strong> so you can also use it with <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html#shallow-rendering\\\"><code>ReactShallowRenderer</code></a> just fine.</p>\\n<p>This is currently the least documented part of React DnD because it exposes the underlying concepts from the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/react-dnd/dnd-core\\\">DnD Core</a>, the library powering React DnD inside. You can learn more about the test backend and its methods from the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/react-dnd/dnd-core/tree/v1.1.0/src/__tests__\\\">DnD Core tests</a>.</p>\\n<p>First, you need to install the test backend:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\">npm install <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >--</span>save<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >-</span>dev react<span class=\\\"token

href=\\\"docs-overview.html\\\">the overview</a>, it&#39;s the adventure time! Even if you have not, you can skip it for now, because ⅔ of our time we&#39;ll be busy identifying and building normal React components, just like in the classic <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html\\\">Thinking in React</a> tutorial. Adding the drag and drop support is just the icing on the cake.</p>\\n<p>In this tutorial, we&#39;re going to build a Chess game with React and React DnD. Just kidding! Writing a full-blown Chess game is totally out of scope of this tutorial. <strong>What we&#39;re going to build is a tiny app with a Chess board and a lonely Knight. The Knight will be draggable according to the Chess rules.</strong></p>\\n<p>We will use this example to demonstrate the data-driven approach of React DnD. You will learn how to create a drag source and a drop target, wire them together with your components, and change their appearance in response to the drag and drop events.</p>\\n<p>If you&#39;re new to React and know a thing or two about it, but yet have to gain some experience building components, this tutorial can also serve as an introduction to the React mode of thinking and the React workflow. <strong>If you are a seasoned React developer and only came here for the drag and drop part, feel free to skip to the third and the final chapter of this tutorial.</strong></p>\\n<p>Enough talk! It&#39;s time to set up a build workflow for our little project. I use <a href=\\\"http://webpack.github.io/\\\">Webpack</a>, you might be using <a href=\\\"http://browserify.org/\\\">Browserify</a>. I don&#39;t want to get into that now, so just set up an empty React project in whatever way is most convenient for you. If you&#39;re feeling lazy, you are free to clone <a href=\\\"https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate\\\">React Hot Boilerplate</a> and work on top of it. In fact, that&#39;s what I&#39;m going to do myself.</p>\\n<p>In this tutorial, the code examples are available simultaneously in ES5, ES6, and <a href=\\\"docs-faq.html\\\">ES7</a>. If you want to follow along using ES6 or ES7, you will need to set up a compilation step using <a href=\\\"https://babeljs.io/\\\">Babel</a>. It&#39;s easy to <a href=\\\"https://babeljs.io/docs/using-babel/\\\">make it work with the tool of your choice</a> so we&#39;re going to skip this step, too, and assume you&#39;ve dealt with it and you are ready to write code now. The boilerplate project <a href=\\\"https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate\\\">I linked to before</a> already includes Babel.</p>\\n<p>The app we&#39;re going to build is <a href=\\\"examples-chessboard-tutorial-app.html\\\">available as an example on this website</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Identifying the Components<a id=\\\"identifying-the-components\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>We&#39;re going to start by creating some React components first, with no thoughts of the drag and drop interaction. Which components is our Lonely Knight app going to be made of? I can think of a few:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>Knight</code>, our lonely knight piece;</li>\\n<li><code>Square</code>, a single square on the board;</li>\\n<li><code>Board</code>, the whole board with 64 squares.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Let&#39;s consider their props.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><p><code>Knight</code> probably needs no props. It has a position, but there&#39;s no reason for the <code>Knight</code> to know it, because it can be positioned by being placed into a <code>Square</code> as a child.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p>It is tempting to give <code>Square</code> its position via props, but this, again, is not necessary, because the only information it really needs for the rendering is the color. I&#39;m going to make <code>Square</code> white by default, and add a <code>black</code> boolean prop. And of course <code>Square</code> may accept a single child: the chess piece that is currently on it. I chose white as the default background color to match the browser defaults.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p>The <code>Board</code> is tricky. It makes no sense to pass <code>Square</code>s as children to it, because what else could a board contain? Therefore it probably owns the <code>Square</code>s. But then, it also needs to own the <code>Knight</code> because this guy needs to be placed inside one of those <code>Square</code>s. This means that the <code>Board</code> needs to know the knight&#39;s current position. In a real Chess game, the <code>Board</code> would accept a data structure describing all the pieces, their colors and positions, but for us, a <code>knightPosition</code> prop will suffice. We will use two-item arrays as coordinates, with <code>[0, 0]</code> referring to the A8 square. Why A8 instead of A1? To match the browser coordinate orientation. I tried it another way and it just messed with my head too much.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Where will the current state live? I really don&#39;t want to put it into the <code>Board</code> component. It&#39;s a good idea to have as little state in your components as possible, and because the <code>Board</code> will already have some layout logic, I don&#39;t want to also burden it with managing the state.</p>\\n<p>The good news is, it doesn&#39;t matter at this point. We&#39;re just going to write the components as if the state existed <em>somewhere</em>, and make sure that they render correctly when they receive it via props, and think about managing the state afterwards!</p>\\n<h2>Creating the Components<a id=\\\"creating-the-components\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>I prefer to start bottom-up, because this way I&#39;m always working with something that already exists. If I were to build the <code>Board</code> first, I wouldn&#39;t see my results until I&#39;m done with the <code>Square</code>. On the other hand, I can build and see the <code>Square</code> right away without even thinking of the <code>Board</code>. I think that the immediate feedback loop is important (you can tell that by <a href=\\\"https://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/\\\">another project I work on</a>).</p>\\n<p>In fact I&#39;m going to start with the <code>Knight</code>. It doesn&#39;t have any props at all, and it&#39;s the easiest one to build:</p>\\n<hr/>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >var</span> <span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >React</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\" >require<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'react'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >var</span> createReactClass <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\" >require<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'create-react-class'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >var</span> <span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >Knight</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\" >createReactClass<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n  render<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token block-keyword\\\" >function</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >return</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span>span<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>♘<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span>span<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n\\nmodule<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>exports <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span> <span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >Knight</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span></code><hr/>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >import</span> <span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >React</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span> <span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >Component</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span> from <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'react'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >export</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >default</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >class</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\" >Knight</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >extends</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\" >Component</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token function\\\" >render<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >return</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span>span<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>♘<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span>span<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span></code><hr/>\\n<hr/>\\n<p>Yes, ♘ is the Unicode knight!

I made a few mistakes:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><p>I forgot to give <code>Square</code> any dimensions so it just collapses. I don&#39;t want it to have any fixed size, so I&#39;ll give it <code>width: &#39;100%&#39;</code> and <code>height: &#39;100%&#39;</code> to fill the container.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p>I forgot to put <code>{this.props.children}</code> inside the <code>div</code> returned by the <code>Square</code>, so it ignores the <code>Knight</code> passed to it.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Even after correcting these two mistakes, I still can&#39;t see my <code>Knight</code> when the <code>Square</code> is <code>black</code>. That&#39;s because the default page body text color is black, so it is not visible on the black <code>Square</code>. I could have fixed this by giving <code>Knight</code> a color prop, but a much simpler fix is to set a corresponding <code>color</code> style in the same place where I set <code>backgroundColor</code>. This version of <code>Square</code> corrects the mistakes and works equally great with both colors:</p>\\n<hr/>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >var</span> <span

I&#39;m now going to add a whole bunch of them! But I don&#39;t know where to start. What do I put in <code>render</code>? Some kind of a <code>for</code> loop? A <code>map</code> over some array?</p>\\n<p>To be honest, I don&#39;t want to think about it now. I already know how to render a single square with or without a knight. I also know the knight&#39;s position thanks to the <code>knightPosition</code> prop. This means I can write the <code>renderSquare</code> method and not worry about rendering the whole board just yet.</p>\\n<p>My first attempt at <code>renderSquare</code> looks like

I&#39;m going to try <a href=\\\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes\\\">Flexbox</a> because why not. I added some styles to the root <code>div</code>, and also wrapped the <code>Square</code>s into <code>div</code>s so I could lay them out. Generally it&#39;s a good idea to keep components encapsulated and ignorant of how they&#39;re being laid out, even if this means adding wrapper <code>div</code>s.</p>\\n<hr/>\\n<code

That&#39;s why people love working with React.</p>\\n<h2>Adding the State<a id=\\\"adding-the-state\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>We want to make the <code>Knight</code> draggable. It&#39;s a noble goal, but we need to see past it. What we really mean is that we want to keep the current <code>knightPosition</code> in some kind of state storage, and have some way to change it.</p>\\n<p>Because setting up this state requires some thought, we won&#39;t try to implement dragging at the same time. Instead, we&#39;ll start with a simpler implementation. We will move the <code>Knight</code> when you click a particular <code>Square</code>, but only if this is allowed by the Chess rules. Implementing this logic should give us enough insight into managing the state, so we can replace clicking with the drag and drop once we&#39;ve dealt with that.</p>\\n<p>React is not opinionated about the state management or the data flow; you can use <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/flux/\\\">Flux</a>, <a href=\\\"https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux\\\">Redux</a>, <a href=\\\"https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS\\\">Rx</a> or <s>even Backbone</s> nah, <a href=\\\"http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html\\\">avoid fat models and separate your reads from writes</a>.</p>\\n<p>I don&#39;t want to bother with installing or setting up Redux for this simple example, so I&#39;m going to follow a simpler pattern. It won&#39;t scale as well as Redux, but I also don&#39;t need it to. I have not decided on the API for my state manager yet, but I&#39;m going to call it <code>Game</code>, and it will definitely need to have some way of signaling data changes to my React code.</p>\\n<p>Since I know this much, I can rewrite my <code>index.js</code> with a hypothetical <code>Game</code> that doesn&#39;t exist yet. Note that this time, I&#39;m writing my code in blind, not being able to run it yet. This is because I&#39;m still figuring out the API:</p>\\n<hr/>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >var</span> <span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >React</span> <span

useful. If we want some interactivity, we&#39;re going to need a way to modify the <code>Game</code> state from our components. For now, I&#39;m going to keep it simple and expose a <code>moveKnight</code> function that directly modifies the internal state. This is not going to fare well in a moderately complex app where different state storages may be interested in updating their state in response to a single user action, but in our case this will

Our goal at this point is to move the <code>Knight</code> to a <code>Square</code> that was clicked. One way to do that is to call <code>moveKnight</code> from the <code>Square</code> itself. However, this would require us to pass the <code>Square</code> its position. Here is a good rule of thumb:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>If a component doesn&#39;t need some data for rendering, it doesn&#39;t need that data at all.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The <code>Square</code> does not need to know its position to render. Therefore, it&#39;s best to avoid coupling it to the <code>moveKnight</code> method at this point. Instead, we are going to add an <code>onClick</code> handler to the <code>div</code> that wraps the <code>Square</code> inside the <code>Board</code>:</p>\\n<hr/>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span

prompted me to write this tutorial. We are now going to see how easy React DnD makes it to add some drag and drop interaction to your existing components.</p>\\n<p>This part assumes you are at least somewhat familiar with the concepts presented in the <a href=\\\"docs-overview.html\\\">overview</a>, such as the backends, the collecting functions, the types, the items, the drag sources, and the drop targets. If you didn&#39;t understand everything, it&#39;s fine, but make sure you at least give it a chance before jumping into the coding process.</p>\\n<p>We&#39;re going to start by installing React DnD and the HTML5 backend for it:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\">npm install <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >--</span>save react<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >-</span>dnd react<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >-</span>dnd<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >-</span>html5<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >-</span>backend</code><p>In the future, you might want to explore alternative third-party backends, such as the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/yahoo/react-dnd-touch-backend\\\">touch backend</a>, but this is out of scope of this tutorial.</p>\\n<p>The first thing we need to set up in our app is the <a href=\\\"docs-drag-drop-context.html\\\"><code>DragDropContext</code></a>. We need it to specify that we&#39;re going to use the <a href=\\\"docs-html5-backend.html\\\"><code>HTML5</code> backend</a> in our app.</p>\\n<p>Because the <code>Board</code> is the top-level component in our app, I&#39;m going to put the <a href=\\\"docs-drag-drop-context.html\\\"><code>DragDropContext</code></a> on it:</p>\\n<hr/>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token

I&#39;m going to create the constants for the draggable item types. We&#39;re only going to have a single item type in our game, a <code>KNIGHT</code>. I&#39;m creating a <code>Constants</code> module that exports it:</p>\\n<hr/>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\">exports<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span><span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >Item</span><span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >Types</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n  KNIGHT<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'knight'</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span></code><hr/>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >export</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >const</span> <span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >Item</span><span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >Types</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n  KNIGHT<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'knight'</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span></code><hr/>\\n<hr/>\\n<p>The preparation work is done now. Let&#39;s make the <code>Knight</code> draggable!</p>\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"docs-drag-source.html\\\"><code>DragSource</code></a> higher-order component accepts three parameters: <code>type</code>, <code>spec</code>, and <code>collect</code>. Our <code>type</code> is the constant we just defined, so now we need to write a drag source specification and a collecting function. For the <code>Knight</code>, the drag source specification is going to be ridiculously simple:</p>\\n<hr/>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >var</span> knightSource <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n  beginDrag<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token block-keyword\\\" >function</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span>props<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >return</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span></code><hr/>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >const</span> knightSource <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token function\\\" >beginDrag<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span>props<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >return</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span></code><hr/>\\n<hr/>\\n<p>This is because there is nothing to describe: there is literally a single draggable object in the whole application! If we had a bunch of chess pieces, it might be a good idea to use the <code>props</code> parameter and return something like <code>{ pieceId: props.id }</code>. In our case, an empty object will suffice.</p>\\n<p>Next, we&#39;re going to write a collecting function. What props does the <code>Knight</code> need? It will sure need a way to specify the drag source node. It would also be nice to slightly dim the <code>Knight</code>&#39;s opacity while it is being dragged. Therefore, it needs to know whether it is currently being dragged.</p>\\n<p>Here is the collecting function I wrote for it:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token block-keyword\\\" >function</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\" >collect<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span>connect<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span> monitor<span class=\\\"token

now a drag source, but there are no drop targets to handle the drop yet. We&#39;re going to make the <code>Square</code> a drop target now.</p>\\n<p>This time, we can&#39;t avoid passing the position to the <code>Square</code>. After all, how can the <code>Square</code> know where to move the dragged knight if the <code>Square</code> doesn&#39;t know its own position? On the other hand, it still feels wrong because the <code>Square</code> as an entity in our application has not changed, and if it used to be simple, why complicate it? When you face this dilemma, it&#39;s time to separate the <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0\\\">smart and dumb components</a>.</p>\\n<p>I&#39;m going to introduce a new component called the <code>BoardSquare</code>. It renders the good old <code>Square</code>, but is also aware of its position. In fact, it&#39;s encapsulating some of the logic that the <code>renderSquare</code> method inside the <code>Board</code> used to do. React components are often extracted from such render submethods when the time is right.</p>\\n<p>Here is the <code>BoardSquare</code> I extracted:</p>\\n<hr/>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span

the monitor whether the pointer is currently over the <code>BoardSquare</code> so I can highlight it:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token block-keyword\\\" >function</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\" >collect<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span>connect<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span> monitor<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span>

id=\\\"final-touches\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><p>This tutorial guided you through creating the React components, making the design decisions about them and the app&#39;s data layer, and finally adding the drag and drop interaction. My intention was to show you that React DnD fits great with the philosophy of React, and that you should think about the app architecture first before diving into implementing the complex interactions.</p>\\n<p>The last thing I want to demonstrate is drag preview customization. Sure, the browser will screenshot the DOM node, but what if we want to show something different?</p>\\n<p>We are lucky again, because it is easy to do with React DnD. We just need to add a <code>connect.dragPreview()</code> to the collecting function of the <code>Knight</code>:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token block-keyword\\\"

href=\\\"examples-chessboard-tutorial-app.html\\\">play with it</a>!</p>\\n\";","module.exports = \"<h1>Overview（概要）<a id=\\\"overview-\\\">&nbsp;</a></h1><p>React DnD is unlike most of the drag and drop libraries out there, and it can be intimidating if you&#39;ve never used it before. However, once you get a taste of a few concepts at the heart of its design, it starts to make sense. I suggest you read about these concepts before the rest of the docs.</p>\\n<p>React DnD 与其他的诸多拖放（Drag/Drop）工具库不同，如果你从未使用过它你可能会觉得这玩意太高深莫测了。但是，一旦你了解到它到部分核心设计思想，它就会变得容易理解。我建议你再阅读文档的其他内容之前，先阅读这一部分概要。</p>\\n<p>Some of these concepts resemble the <a href=\\\"http://facebook.github.io/flux/\\\">Flux</a> and <a href=\\\"https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux\\\">Redux</a> architectures.<br/>This is not a coincidence, as React DnD uses Redux internally.</p>\\n<p>（React DnD的）一些设计思想与 <a href=\\\"http://facebook.github.io/flux/\\\">Flux</a> and <a href=\\\"https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux\\\">Redux</a> 体系相似.<br/>这不是一个巧合, React Dnd 内部就使用了redux.</p>\\n<h3>Backends（背景）<a id=\\\"backends-\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><p>React DnD is built on top of the <a href=\\\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Drag_and_drop\\\">HTML5 drag and drop API</a>. It is a reasonable default because it screenshots the dragged DOM node and uses it as a “drag preview” out of the box. It&#39;s handy that you don&#39;t have to do any drawing as the cursor moves. This API is also the only way to handle the file drop events.</p>\\n<p>React DnD 是建立在 <a href=\\\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Drag_and_drop\\\">HTML5 drag and drop API</a>的基础之上的. 这是一个很棒的API，它捕捉了被拖拽的DOM节点的快照，并将其作为一个被拖动的预览浮层. 这种设计使你不需要重复渲染一个一模一样的元素并且让它跟着你的鼠标跑. 这个API也是处理文件拖放事件的唯一方式.</p>\\n<p>Unfortunately, the HTML5 drag and drop API also has some downsides. It does not work on touch screens, and it provides less customization opportunities on IE than in other browsers.</p>\\n<p>不幸的事, HTML5 drag and drop API 也有一些缺点. 它不能在触摸屏上使用, 而且它再IE浏览器上提供比其它浏览器更少的定制化特性.</p>\\n<p>This is why <strong>the HTML5 drag and drop support is implemented in a pluggable way</strong> in React DnD. You don&#39;t have to use it. You can write a different implementation, based on touch events, mouse events, or something else entirely. Such pluggable implementations are called the <em>backends</em> in React DnD. Only the <a href=\\\"docs-html5-backend.html\\\">HTML5 backend</a> comes with the library, but more may be added in the future.</p>\\n<p>这就是为什么 <strong>HTML5 drag and drop 的支持被以插件的形式集成</strong> 在 React DnD 中. 你并不是必须使用这个插件. 你完全可以自己写一个不同的实现, 基于触摸事件, 鼠标事件, 或者其它完全不同的东西. 这个插件在 React DnD 中被称为 <em>backends</em>. 目前只有 <a href=\\\"docs-html5-backend.html\\\">HTML5 backend</a> 被打包在 React DnD 中, 将来可能会添加更多.</p>\\n<p>The backends perform a similar role to that of React&#39;s synthetic event system: <strong>they abstract away the browser differences and process the native DOM events.</strong> Despite the similarities, React DnD backends do not have a dependency on React or its synthetic event system. Under the hood, all the backends do is translate the DOM events into the internal Redux actions that React DnD can process.</p>\\n<p>这个backends的表现和 React 的模拟事件系统相似: <strong>它通过抽象，抹平了浏览器的差别，并代替你处理原生DOM事件.</strong> 除了这些相同点, React DnD backends 并不依赖React以及它的模拟事件系统. 在底层, 所有的 backends 只是把原生DOM事件处理为 React DnD 可以处理的内部Redux Action.</p>\\n<h3>Items and Types（拖拽单元和类型） -- 不好翻译，后文均使用Item。<a id=\\\"items-and-types-item-\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><p>Like Flux (or Redux), React DnD uses data, and not the views, as the source of truth. When you drag something across the screen, we don&#39;t say that a component, or a DOM node is being dragged. Instead, we say that an <em>item</em> of a certain <em>type</em> is being dragged.</p>\\n<p>就像 Flux (or Redux)一样, React DnD 操作数据, 而不是直接操作视图. 当你将什么东西在屏幕上拖动, 我们并不是说有一个组件或者DOM节点正在被拖动. 而是, 一个特定<em>type（类型）</em>的<em>item</em> 正在被拖动.</p>\\n<p>What is an item? An <em>item</em> is a plain JavaScript object <em>describing</em> what&#39;s being dragged. For example, in a Kanban board application, when you drag a card, an item might look like <code>{ cardId: 42 }</code>. In a Chess game, when you pick up a piece, the item might look like <code>{ fromCell: &#39;C5&#39;, piece: &#39;queen&#39; }</code>. <strong>Describing the dragged data as a plain object helps you keep the components decoupled and unaware of each other.</strong></p>\\n<p>什么是 item? 一个 <em>item</em> 是一个简单的JS对象 <em>描述</em> 什么东西正在被拖动. 例如, 在一个看板应用（Kanban board Application）中, 当你拖拽一个卡片, 它所对应的 item 看起来像 <code>{ cardId: 42 }</code>. 在象棋游戏中, 当你拿起一粒棋子, 它所对应的 item 大概就是 <code>{ fromCell: &#39;C5&#39;, piece: &#39;queen&#39; }</code>. <strong>用一个简单JS对象描述正在被拖动的数据，可以让你的组件与其它组件相互解耦，并且无需关心彼此。</strong></p>\\n<p>What is a type, then? A <em>type</em> is a string (or a <a href=\\\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol\\\">symbol</a>) uniquely identifying <em>a whole class of items</em> in your application. In a Kanban board app, you might have a <code>&#39;card&#39;</code> type representing the draggable cards and a <code>&#39;list&#39;</code> type for the draggable lists of those cards. In Chess, you might only have a single <code>&#39;piece&#39;</code> type.</p>\\n<p>那么，什么是 type（类型）? 一个 <em>type</em> 是一个字符串 (或者是一个 <a href=\\\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol\\\">symbol</a>) 在你的应用中，特定地表示 <em>一系列（同种类型）的items</em> . 在一个看板APP中, 你可能需要一个 <code>&#39;card&#39;</code> 类型代表可以被拖拽的卡片， 以及一个 <code>&#39;list&#39;</code> 类型表示可以被拖拽的卡片列表. 在象棋中, 你可能只需要一个 <code>&#39;piece&#39;</code> 类型，因为可以拖拽的只有棋子这一种东西.</p>\\n<p>Types are useful because, as your app grows, you might want to make more things draggable, but you don&#39;t necessarily want all the existing drop targets to suddenly start reacting to the new items. <strong>The types let you specify which drag sources and drop targets are compatible.</strong> You&#39;re probably going to have an enumeration of the type constants in your application, just like you may have an enumeration of the Redux action types.</p>\\n<h3>Monitors<a id=\\\"monitors\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><p>Drag and drop is inherently stateful. Either a drag operation is in progress, or it isn&#39;t. Either there is a current type and a current item, or there isn&#39;t. This state has to live somewhere.</p>\\n<p>React DnD exposes this state to your components via a few tiny wrappers over the internal state storage called the <em>monitors</em>. <strong>The monitors let you update the props of your components in response to the drag and drop state changes.</strong></p>\\n<p>For each component that needs to track the drag and drop state, you can define a <em>collecting function</em> that retrieves the relevant bits of it from the monitors. React DnD then takes care of timely calling your collecting function and merging its return value into your components&#39; props.</p>\\n<p>Let&#39;s say you want to highlight the Chess cells when a piece is being dragged. A collecting function for the <code>Cell</code> component might look like this:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token block-keyword\\\" >function</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\" >collect<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span>monitor<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >return</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n    highlighted<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> monitor<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\" >canDrop<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span>\\n    hovered<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> monitor<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\" >isOver<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span></code><p>It instructs React DnD to pass the up-to-date values of <code>highlighted</code> and <code>hovered</code> to all the <code>Cell</code> instances as props.</p>\\n<h3>Connectors<a id=\\\"connectors\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><p>If the backend handles the DOM events, but the components use React to describe the DOM, how does the backend know which DOM nodes to listen to? Enter the <em>connectors</em>. <strong>The connectors let you assign one of the predefined roles (a drag source, a drag preview, or a drop target) to the DOM nodes</strong> in your <code>render</code> function.</p>\\n<p>In fact, a connector is passed as the first argument to the <em>collecting function</em> we described above. Let&#39;s see how we can use it to specify the drop target:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token block-keyword\\\" >function</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\" >collect<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span>connect<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span> monitor<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span> <span class=\\\"token

punctuation\\\" >}</span></code><p>In the component&#39;s <code>render</code> method, we are then able to access both the data obtained from the monitor, and the function obtained from the connector:</p>\\n<hr/>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\">render<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token block-keyword\\\" >function</span> <span class=\\\"token

call tells React DnD that the root DOM node of our component is a valid drop target, and that its hover and drop events should be handled by the backend. Internally it works by attaching a <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/more-about-refs.html#the-ref-callback-attribute\\\">callback ref</a> to the React element you gave it. The function returned by the connector is memoized, so it doesn&#39;t break the <code>shouldComponentUpdate</code> optimizations.</p>\\n<h3>Drag Sources and Drop Targets<a id=\\\"drag-sources-and-drop-targets\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><p>So far we have covered the backends which work with the DOM, the data, as represented by the items and types, and the collecting functions that, thanks to the monitors and the connectors, let you describe what props React DnD should inject into your components.</p>\\n<p>But how do we configure our components to actually have those props injected? How do we perform the side effects in response to the drag and drop events? Meet the <em>drag sources</em> and the <em>drop targets</em>, the primary abstraction units of React DnD. <strong>They really tie the types, the items, the side effects, and the collecting functions together with your components.</strong></p>\\n<p>Whenever you want to make a component or some part of it draggable, you need to wrap that component into a <em>drag source</em> declaration. Every drag source is registered for a certain <em>type</em>, and has to implement a method producing an <em>item</em> from the component&#39;s props. It can also optionally specify a few other methods for handling the drag and drop events. The drag source declaration also lets you specify the <em>collecting function</em> for the given component.</p>\\n<p>The <em>drop targets</em> are very similar to the drag sources. The only difference is that a single drop target may register for several item types at once, and instead of producing an item, it may handle its hover or drop.</p>\\n<h3>Higher-Order Components and ES7 decorators<a id=\\\"higher-order-components-and-es7-decorators\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><p>How do you wrap your components? What does wrapping even mean? If you have not worked with higher-order components before, go ahead and read <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/mixins-are-dead-long-live-higher-order-components-94a0d2f9e750\\\">this article</a>, as it explains the concept in detail.</p>\\n<p><strong>A higher-order component is just a function that takes a React component class, and returns another React component class.</strong> The wrapping component provided by the library renders <em>your</em> component in its <code>render</code> method and forwards the props to it, but also adds some useful behavior.</p>\\n<p>In React DnD, <a href=\\\"docs-drag-source.html\\\"><code>DragSource</code></a> and <a href=\\\"docs-drop-target.html\\\"><code>DropTarget</code></a>, as well as a few other top-level exported functions, are in fact higher-order components. They breathe the drag and drop magic into your components.</p>\\n<p>One caveat of using them is that they require <em>two</em> function applications.

widgets, React DnD wraps your components and injects props into them. If you use React Router or Flummox, you already know this pattern.</p>\\n<h3>It embraces unidirectional data flow<a id=\\\"it-embraces-unidirectional-data-flow\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><p>React DnD fully embraces the declarative rendering paradigm of React and doesn&#39;t mutate the DOM. It is a great complement to Redux and other architectures with the unidirectional data flow. In fact it is built on Redux.</p>\\n<h3>It hides the platform quirks<a id=\\\"it-hides-the-platform-quirks\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><p>HTML5 drag and drop has an awkward API full of pitfalls and browser inconsistencies. React DnD handles them internally for you, so you can focus on developing your application instead of working around the browser bugs.</p>\\n<h3>It is extensible and testable<a id=\\\"it-is-extensible-and-testable\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><p>React DnD uses the HTML5 drag and drop under the hood, but it also lets you supply a custom “backend”. You can create a custom DnD backend based on the touch events, the mouse events, or something else entirely. For example, a built-in simulation backend lets you test drag and drop interaction of your components in a Node environment.</p>\\n<h3>It is ready for the future<a id=\\\"it-is-ready-for-the-future\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><p>React DnD does not export mixins, and works equally great with any components, whether they are created using ES6 classes, <code>createReactClass</code> or alternative React frameworks such as Omniscient. Its API shines with ES7 decorators if you like to be on the bleeding edge, but it also feels natural in both ES5 and ES6.</p>\\n<h2>Touch Support<a id=\\\"touch-support\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>For touch support, use React DnD with <a href=\\\"https://github.com/yahoo/react-dnd-touch-backend\\\">the touch backend</a> instead of the HTML5 backend.</p>\\n<h2>Non-Goals<a id=\\\"non-goals\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>React DnD gives you a set of powerful primitives, but it does not contain any readymade components. It&#39;s lower level than <a href=\\\"https://jqueryui.com/\\\">jQuery UI</a> or <a href=\\\"http://interactjs.io/\\\">interact.js</a> and is focused on getting the drag and drop interaction right, leaving its visual aspects such as axis constraints or snapping to you. For example, React DnD doesn&#39;t plan to provide a <code>Sortable</code> component. Instead it makes it easy for you to build your own, with any rendering customizations that you need.</p>\\n<h2>Support and Contributions<a id=\\\"support-and-contributions\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Issues and potential improvements are discussed on <a href=\\\"https://github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd/issues\\\">Github</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Thanks<a id=\\\"thanks\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Big thanks to <a href=\\\"https://www.browserstack.com\\\">BrowserStack</a> for letting the maintainers use their service to debug browser issues.</p>\\n<h2>License<a id=\\\"license\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>React DnD is licensed as MIT.
